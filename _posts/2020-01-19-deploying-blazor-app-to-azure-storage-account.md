This post is about deploying Blazor apps to Azure Storage account. Blazor lets you build interactive web UIs using C# instead of JavaScript. Blazor supports two variations - Blazor Server is supported in ASP.NET Core 3.0. Blazor WebAssembly is in preview for ASP.NET Core 3.1.

For Blazor server is using ASP.NET Core SignalR and IIS or any other server. For WebAssembly you don't need any servers. So first we need to install Blazor WebAssembly template.

You can install the template using following command - `dotnet new -i Microsoft.AspNetCore.Blazor.Templates::3.1.0-preview4.19579.2`. Next you can create Blazor WebAssembly project using following command - `dotnet new blazorwasm -o BlazorApp1`. Next you can build the app using `dotnet publish -c Release` command. Next you need to create a storage account - StorageV2 (general purpose v2). Then you need to enable the Static Website option.

Once enabled, you can configure the index document name and error document path. For deploying the Blazor app, copy the files and folders from `dist` directory under `bin\Release` folder to the `$web` container in the Storage Account - this container will be created when you enable the static website option.

You can improve the performance of the app by configuring CDN endpoint for Azure Storage account. You can also create backend for Blazor app using Azure Functions.

Happy Programming :)
